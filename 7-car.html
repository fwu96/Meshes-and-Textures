<p>The pedagogical goals of this exercise are to give you practice defining shapes with meshes and adding textures to them.</p>
<p>In graphics town, you will need vehicles. A cars, trucks, trains, or maybe other things.</p>
<p>So in this page, please make one. It has to have wheels on the ground. But other than that, few restrictions - you can have a primitive (like a box or something) for the body. The vehicle must either have shape or texture to make it look like a car/truck/train.</p>
<p>If you want a simple train made out of primitives, you can look at <a href="https://discoverthreejs.com/book/1-first-steps/6-shapes-transformations/">this tutorial</a> for a simple train made out of primitives. If you use it, be sure to give attribution (and put it into the graphics town framework).</p>
<p>To get the point for this page, you just have to have a simple car (defined as a <code>GrObject</code> in <code>7-car.js</code> and placed into the world in <a href="7-cardemo.html"><code>7-cardemo.html</code></a>).</p>
<p>You will need vehicles for the future assignments, so effort you put into making nice vehicles now will pay off in future workbooks. You can make more vehicle types later - but you may want to do some of the work now. (hint: you will need at least a train and a car/truck in future weeks).</p>
<p>The rules for finding and importing object files and textures are the same as for page 6.</p>
<p>Your Vehicles should be subclasses of <code>GrObject</code>. Your work goes into <code>7-car.js</code> and <code>7-1-cardemo.js</code>. You'll see it in <a href="7-1-cardemo.html"><code>7-cardemo.html</code></a>).</p>
